## What I have learnt By working on this project

1. I have improved my research skill on the google.
2. Got a concept of sibling selectors.
3. I had fun with `opacity` and `positioning` properties with hands on experience.

## Honest Time to finish the project

I had took about 6 hours approximately to fully complete this project as i was new to HTML and CSS and I had to learn some new things like sibling selectors without class and different positioning.
